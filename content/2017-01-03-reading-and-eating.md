## Reading
1. Andrej Karpathy reminds you that [**"Yes you should understand backprop"**](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b#.jf28tuhfd). For an intuitive and in-depth intro to backpropogation I recommend his convolutional neural network [lectures](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).
2. Bill Bryson - [**The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way
**](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29.The_Mother_Tongue), an entertaining if sometimes undirected tour through the history of the English language.
3. Roger Lowenstein - [**When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management**](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10669.When_Genius_Failed). It was interesting, although the author's misuse of Statistical concepts and terminology got on my nerves. But I'm generally very interested in reading about how groups of smart, well-informed people can make terrible mistakes.
4. Everything I can about being a tourist in [**Mexico City**](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/travel/mexico-city-culture-childhood-new-awakening.htm)

## Eating
1. [**Desimone's**](https://www.facebook.com/Desimones-889818314369989/), Facebook's main cafeteria, where I eat 2-3 meals a day most weekdays. I'm constantly impressed by the food quality and creativity.
2. This is a bit late, but for one weekend this past October I ate way too many [**bagels in Montreal**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/fairmount-bagel-bakery-inc-montr%C3%A9al-2). Poutine is very tasty, but if I lived in the cold north I'd be much more thankful for these bagels.
3. [**Lam Zhou**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lam-zhou-handmade-noodle-new-york-2). It's not exactly a new restaurant for me but I have yet to find a dumpling spot I prefer in Manhattan.
4. [**BaoHaus**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/baohaus-new-york-2) for Taiwanese comfort food buns, it's way better than I would expect such a celebrity-driven restaurant to be. I'm sad to say I lived nearby for over 2 years before trying it.
